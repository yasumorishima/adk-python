## Project Overview

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents.

### Key Components

- **Agent**: Blueprint defining identity, instructions, and tools.
- **Runner**: Stateless execution engine that orchestrates agent execution.
- **Tool**: Functions/capabilities agents can call.
- **Session**: Conversation state management.
- **Memory**: Long-term recall across sessions.
- **Workflow** (ADK 2.0): Graph-based orchestration of complex, multi-step agent interactions.
- **BaseNode** (ADK 2.0): Contract for all nodes, supporting output streaming and human-in-the-loop steps.
- **Context** (ADK 2.0): Holds execution state and telemetry context mapped 1:1 to nodes.

For details on how the Runner works and the invocation lifecycle, please refer to the `adk-architecture` skill and the referenced documentation therein.
