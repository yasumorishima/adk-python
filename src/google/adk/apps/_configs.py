  The "resumability" in ADK refers to the ability to:
  1. pause an invocation upon a long-running function call.
  2. resume an invocation from the last event, if it's paused or failed midway
  through.

  Note: ADK resumes the invocation in a best-effort manner:
  1. Tool call to resume needs to be idempotent because we only guarantee
  an at-least-once behavior once resumed.
  2. Any temporary / in-memory state will be lost upon resumption.
