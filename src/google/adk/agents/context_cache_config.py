class ContextCacheConfig(BaseModel):
  """Configuration for context caching across all agents in an app.

  This configuration enables and controls context caching behavior for
  all LLM agents in an app. When this config is present on an app, context
  caching is enabled for all agents. When absent (None), context caching
  is disabled.

  Context caching can significantly reduce costs and improve response times
  by reusing previously processed context across multiple requests.

  Caching begins on the second turn of a session at the earliest and requires
  the cacheable prefix to reach the model-specific minimum: 2048 tokens for
  Gemini 2.5 or 4096 tokens for Gemini 3. Short or single-turn sessions are
  therefore never cached.

  Attributes:
      cache_intervals: Maximum number of invocations to reuse the same cache before refreshing it
      ttl_seconds: Time-to-live for cache in seconds
      min_tokens: Minimum prior-request tokens required to enable caching
