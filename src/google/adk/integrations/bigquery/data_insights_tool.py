  """Answers questions about structured data in BigQuery tables using natural language.

  This function takes a user's question (which can include conversational
  history for context) and references to specific BigQuery tables, and sends
  them to a stateless conversational API.

  The API uses a GenAI agent to understand the question, generate and execute
  SQL queries and Python code, and formulate an answer. This function returns a
  detailed, sequential log of this entire process, which includes any generated
  SQL or Python code, the data retrieved, and the final text answer. The final
  answer is always in plain text, as the underlying API is instructed not to
  generate any charts, graphs, images, or other visualizations.

  Use this tool to perform data analysis, get insights, or answer complex
  questions about the contents of specific BigQuery tables.

  Args:
      project_id (str): The project that the inquiry is performed in.
      user_query_with_context (str): The user's original request, enriched with
        relevant context from the conversation history. The user's core intent
        should be preserved, but context should be added to resolve ambiguities
        in follow-up questions.
      table_references (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries, each
        specifying a BigQuery table to be used as context for the question.
      credentials (Credentials): The credentials to use for the request.
      settings (BigQueryToolConfig): The settings for the tool.

  Returns:
      A dictionary with two keys:
      - 'status': A string indicating the final status (e.g., "SUCCESS").
      - 'response': A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
        represents a step in the API's execution process (e.g., SQL
        generation, data retrieval, final answer).

  Example:
      A query joining multiple tables, showing the full return structure.
      The original question: "Which customer from New York spent the most last
      month?"
