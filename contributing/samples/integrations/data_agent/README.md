# Data Agent Sample

This sample agent demonstrates ADK's first-party tools for interacting with
Data Agents powered by [Conversational Analytics API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/conversational-analytics-api/overview).
These tools are distributed via
the `google.adk.tools.data_agent` module and allow you to list,
inspect, and
chat with Data Agents using natural language.

These tools leverage stateful conversations, meaning you can ask follow-up
questions in the same session, and the agent will maintain context.

## Prerequisites

1. An active Google Cloud project with BigQuery and Gemini APIs enabled.
1. Google Cloud authentication configured for Application Default Credentials:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
1. At least one Data Agent created. You could create data agents via
   [Conversational API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/conversational-analytics-api/overview),
   its
   [Python SDK](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/conversational-analytics-api/build-agent-sdk),
   or for BigQuery data
   [BigQuery Studio](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-data-agents#create_a_data_agent).
   These agents are created and configured in the Google Cloud console and
   point to your BigQuery tables or other data sources.
1. Follow the official
   [Setup and prerequisites](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/conversational-analytics-api/overview#setup)
   guide to enable the API and configure IAM permissions and authentication for
   your data sources.

## Tools Used

- `list_accessible_data_agents`: Lists Data Agents you have permission to
  access in the configured GCP project.
- `get_data_agent_info`: Retrieves details about a specific Data Agent given
  its full resource name.
- `ask_data_agent`: Chats with a specific Data Agent using natural language.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the root of the ADK repository.
1. Run the agent using the ADK CLI:
   ```bash
   adk run --agent-path contributing/samples/data_agent
   ```
1. The CLI will prompt you for input. You can ask questions like the examples
   below.

## Sample prompts

- "List accessible data agents."
- "Using agent
  `projects/my-project/locations/global/dataAgents/sales-agent-123`, who were
  my top 3 customers last quarter?"
- "How does that compare to the quarter before?"
