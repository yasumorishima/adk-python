# ADK Issue Monitoring Agent 🛡️

An intelligent, cost-optimized, automated moderation agent built with the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

This agent automatically audits GitHub repository issues to detect SEO spam, unsolicited promotional links, and irrelevant third-party endorsements. If spam is detected, it automatically applies a `spam` label and alerts the repository maintainers.

## ✨ Key Features & Optimizations

- **Zero-Waste LLM Invocations:** Fetches issue comments via REST APIs and pre-filters them in Python. It automatically ignores comments from maintainers, `[bot]` accounts, and the official `adk-bot`. The Gemini LLM is never invoked for safe threads, saving 100% of the token cost.
- **Dual-Mode Scanning:** Can perform a **Deep Clean** (auditing the entire history of all open issues) or a **Daily Sweep** (only fetching issues updated within the last 24 hours).
- **Token Truncation:** Uses Regular Expressions to strip out Markdown code blocks (```` ``` ````) replacing them with `[CODE BLOCK REMOVED]`, and truncates unusually long text to 1,500 characters before sending it to the AI.
- **Idempotency (Anti-Double-Posting):** The bot reads the comment history for its own signature. If it has already flagged an issue, it instantly skips it, preventing infinite feedback loops.

## Configuration

The agent is configured via environment variables, typically set as secrets in GitHub Actions.

### Required Secrets

| Secret Name      | Description                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`   | A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) or Service Account Token with `repo` and `issues: write` scope. |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | An API key for the Google AI (Gemini) model used for reasoning.                                      |

### Optional Configuration

These variables control the scanning behavior, thresholds, and model selection.

| Variable Name          | Description                                                                                                        | Default                 |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `INITIAL_FULL_SCAN`    | If `true`, audits every open issue in the repository. If `false`, only audits issues updated in the last 24 hours. | `false`                 |
| `SPAM_LABEL_NAME`      | The exact text of the label applied to flagged issues.                                                             | `spam`                  |
| `BOT_NAME`             | The GitHub username of your official bot to ensure its comments are ignored.                                       | `adk-bot`               |
| `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT`    | The number of issues to process concurrently.                                                                      | `3`                     |
| `SLEEP_BETWEEN_CHUNKS` | Time in seconds to sleep between batches to respect GitHub API rate limits.                                        | `1.5`                   |
| `LLM_MODEL_NAME`       | The specific Gemini model version to use.                                                                          | `gemini-2.5-flash`      |
| `OWNER`                | Repository owner (auto-detected in Actions).                                                                       | (Environment dependent) |
| `REPO`                 | Repository name (auto-detected in Actions).                                                                        | (Environment dependent) |

## Deployment

To deploy this agent, a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/issue-monitor.yml`) is recommended.

### Directory Structure Note

Because this agent resides within the `adk-python` package structure, the workflow must ensure the script is executed correctly to handle imports. It must be run as a module from the parent directory.

### Example Workflow Execution

```yaml
      - name: Run ADK Issue Monitoring Agent
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GOOGLE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY }}
          OWNER: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          REPO: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          # Mapped to the manual trigger checkbox in the GitHub UI
          INITIAL_FULL_SCAN: ${{ github.event.inputs.full_scan == 'true' }}
          PYTHONPATH: contributing/samples
        run: python -m adk_issue_monitoring_agent.main
```
